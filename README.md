### Introduction
`VLMinorityGameKit.jl` is a [Julia package](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/) that implements the Minority Game by Challet and Zhang:

[Challet D, Zhang Y.C., (1998) On the minority game: Analytical and numerical studies. Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications. Volume 256, Pg. 514-532](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9805084)

### Installation and Requirements 
`VLMinorityGameKit.jl` is organized as a [Julia](http://julialang.org) package which can be installed in the ``package mode`` of Julia.

Start of the [Julia REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/index.html) and enter the ``package mode`` using the ``]`` key (to get back press the ``backspace`` or ``^C`` keys). Then, at the prompt enter:
